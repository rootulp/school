I enjoyed the first part of this assignment but the second part took a very long to even get set up because of the google maps api. It also took me a while to realize how to serialize the artist object. I really enjoyed the caricature images though!

Sometimes the locations don't get accuratley painted on the map and instead a marker gets dropped at the equator. Weird bug but I'm not sure what's causing it.

RootulJsonA is the first part.
