Assignment 3 part a took a while. I started it late and ran into an error after moving the folder / renaming the project. I restarted and that's why my assignment is late. Anyway, there are a few bugs in my code... 1. the slider bar doesn't get updated when a user selects .10, .15, or .20. Also, although the round up button rounds the 'each individual total' ammount up, it also rounds up the individual tip amount. This is a bug because we're rounding these numbers up without any checks so individual tip amount + the bill amount could not sum to the individual total amount. Minor detail but thought I would point it out. Also I originally had the calculateWhole function replicate a lot of the functions in calculateDecimal but I ended up deciding against it and just called calculateDecimal from within calculateWhole and then called ceil() on the results.

Assignment 3 part b was fairly straight forward. I did this assignment differently from the previous ones, primarily coding first and doing the design after. To be honest, this ended with a pretty poor looking app. I lazily tossed the buttons at the top and the to-do's under. If I had more time and could start over, I would ideally like to design the app to look similar to apps like any.do or wunderlist. Design is much tougher to mess with after the bulk of your code has been written. On the other hand, writing code first allows you to focus on the more important functionality rather than the nitty-gritty design details. There's a toss up there. Also I have a slight bug in my app in that after you delete a to-do, the next to-do gets automatically selected. This is because I'm referencing to-do's by their location (index in an array). Not a huge deal just something worth noting.
