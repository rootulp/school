My Part A was largely based on Prof. Sig's simple intent demo app. There wasn't a whole lot to change beside the calculations for the trig functions and a little bit of formatting it better. I also did error checking on the first activity to see if the numbers were both positive. If they weren't toast the user to input positive numbers.

Part B took a lot longer. I created separate activities for each page and each button led to another new intent -> bundle -> startActivity. I choose not to import images for all the toppings because I thought that would waste too much space and wouldn't be a great use of time. Before order confirmation and size selection, I checked if the string representations of each were empty so I could toast the user if they forgot to select or input something.
