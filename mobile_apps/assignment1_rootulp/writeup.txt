Design:
The design for my calculator came from the calculator preinstalled on most Mac
computers. The layout resembles a grid or table with the 0 number taking up two
columns. The output sits at the top of the screen and spans the width of the
calculator. After deciding on this layout, I tried to implement it in Android
Studio. I quickly realized that the relative layout was far too tedious and when
adding several buttons to my Application, some buttons became relative to each
other and the whole app came out looking like a mess. I did some research online
and found the table layout which lets you structure your application in rows and
columns (essentially an html table). I added all the digits and operations to
the table and the app came out looking pretty good. I'm unsure as to how the app
would display on different screen sizes like tablets but it looks decent on
phones. Also after I drew the initial sketch, I realized that the percent sign
wasn't necessary so I doubled the width of the equals sign to fill the empty
cell in the table.

Implementation:
To implement my calculator, I copied over a decent amount of code from the
simple calculator demo. I realized we would need to be able to manipulate
decimal values so I switched the ints to floats and made the decimal point
insert a string decimal point. Every time I needed to manipulate the
number, I would read the string from output and convert it to a float.
Some other changes/additions include:
- Errors if output is infinity or not a number
- Sign button that multiplys current number by negative 1
- Implement a decimal flag to stop app crashing when trying to insert 2 decimal
  points in same number
