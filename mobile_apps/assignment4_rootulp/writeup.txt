Mobile Apps HW4

I never finished part A. I'll probably work on it more tomorrow but I can't get
it finished before the deadline. I was having a lot of trouble creating multiple
databases for the lists.

On the other hand, part B was pretty fun. I didn't like hardcoding possible
solutions because it seems like there has to be a better way to check for
winners but this is all I could think of. Also I didn't pay particularly close
attention to the design / asthetic of the app but I did mess around a little
with the colors.
