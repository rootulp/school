For this assignment I tried to design my classes before getting into
implementation but I ended up building out classes that didn't get used (as in
ComputerPlayer). My reasoning behind this abstract class was to toss common
computer logic into this class but I ended up making fairly specific makeMove
methods for each Player and therefore couldn't abstract any logic to a higher
class. Given more time and more iterations, I would ideally like to remove some
of this specific logic from makeMove into a higher level abstract class.

To use this assignment, you must define the types of Players to use in the
simulation in playerTypes of HW2DiceGame.java

The three valid types of players are:
- "HumanPlayer"
- "ConservativeComputerPlayer"
- "AggressiveComputerPlayer"

As the HumanPlayer you must enter 1 or 2 depending on whether you want to take
the pot or reroll
