I enjoyed working with pipes on this homework assignment. I couldn't find the
Moby Dick txt file on canvas so I tossed in the first paragraph of the
SparkNotes summary into input.txt. I also added a couple lines of 'foo bar baz'
in various capitalization arrangmenets for testing purposes.

Compile with gcc -o main.exe main.c
Run with ./main
Compare txt files with cat input.txt and cat output.txt
