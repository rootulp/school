Ishmael, the narrator, announces his intent to ship aboard a whaling vessel. He
has made several voyages as a sailor but none as a whaler. He travels to New
Bedford, Massachusetts, where he stays in a whalers’ inn. Since the inn is
rather full, he has to share a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named
Queequeg. At first repulsed by Queequeg’s strange habits and shocking appearance
(Queequeg is covered with tattoos), Ishmael eventually comes to appreciate the
man’s generosity and kind spirit, and the two decide to seek work on a whaling
vessel together. They take a ferry to Nantucket, the traditional capital of the
whaling industry. There they secure berths on the Pequod, a savage-looking ship
adorned with the bones and teeth of sperm whales. Peleg and Bildad, the Pequod’s
Quaker owners, drive a hard bargain in terms of salary. They also mention the
ship’s mysterious captain, Ahab, who is still recovering from losing his leg in
an encounter with a sperm whale on his last voyage.
