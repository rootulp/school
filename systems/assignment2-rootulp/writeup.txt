This assignment was fairly similar to assignment 1. Part A took the longest time but after that, Parts B C and D all followed pretty quickly. The tough part was saving the index of the first occurence of 'G'. For B and C, I basically removed all the else clauses that reset state to START. Instead you remain at the state you were currently in. Besides that, the design of the FSM stayed pretty consistent between Parts. Also for Part B & C, I tossed in an if statement to check if the number of contiguous characters exceeded 10. For Part D, this was substitutded for a print statement with the number of matches.
